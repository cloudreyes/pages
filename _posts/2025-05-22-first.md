title: "Creating this site and the motivation behind"

I am starting to learn some new topics about AI which is a field where I am not comfortable. I guess it was time to teach new tricks to this old dog.

I remember back when I was in college that writting what I learned helped me to keep that knowledge in my head, and even better when I had a chance to tutor some of my classmates before having exams. So, I decided to start this site as a place to publish my "tutor notes".

As I grow older, I do not want to mess up with HTML, CSS, JavaScript or any other tool that the cool kids are using in these days, so I guess the sensible option is to rely on GitHub and do things their way.

I followed the tutorial that they offer at this link, https://github.com/skills/github-pages. It also seems like I need to learn Markdown and how Jekyll handles the creation of the site.

Anyway, I will post all that as I start learning.
